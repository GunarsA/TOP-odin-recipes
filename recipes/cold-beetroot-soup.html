    <h2>Description</h2>
    <a>
      In the sultry summer days that followed each other without respite this 
      year, most cooks tried to avoid spending too much time at a hot stove. 
      There is one dish that will always save the day, even the hottest—cold 
      soup.
    </a>
    <a>
      Cold soup is made from kefir, or curdled milk, with cooked beetroot, 
      chopped radish, fresh cucumber, boiled eggs, and various herbs. The 
      taste should be a balance between sour, sweet, and salt. This dish is a 
      summer classic in all Baltic kitchens. It is very easy to prepare and 
      a perfect lunch option on a hot summer day.

        Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and cover the eggs with

        Remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 
        minutes; drain. Cool the eggs under cold running water in the sink. 
        Peel and chop the eggs.
