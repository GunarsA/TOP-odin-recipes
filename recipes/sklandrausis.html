    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sklandrausis is a sweet pie yellowish-orange in color from the carrots
       used for the filling. The base is made from a firm rye flour dough.
       Once rolled out, circles of dough, 8-14 cm diameter, are cut out and
       the edges are folded upwards.
    <p/>
    <p>
      The base is then filled with boiled potato and carrot filling, potato
      on the bottom and carrot on top. A layer of cream, cinnamon, or caraway
      seeds is then spread on top. The flavor of the sklandrausis can range 
      from sweet to very sweet, dominated by carrot, while the pastry base 
      has a very distinct flavor.
