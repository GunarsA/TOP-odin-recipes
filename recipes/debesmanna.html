    <ol>

        and sugar, and bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually sprinkle in the cream of wheat, whisking briskly to make 
        sure the mixture doesn't get lumpy. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, 
        whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.

        Scrape the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk, 
        and beat on medium-high speed until the pudding is thick and doubled 
        in volume, about 12 minutes.
